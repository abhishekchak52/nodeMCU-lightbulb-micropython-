# NodeMCU lightbulb in Micropython

IoT lightbulb on NodeMCU controlled using http://light-switch-toggle.herokuapp.com


This is a reimplementation of my `nodeMCU-lightbulb` in Micropython. 


A few short programs will be tried before the final program is implemented. 

Upload a file `credentials.py` containing your network SSID and password in variables. For example

```
ssid = 'SSID'
password = 'password'
```
